ptpb

ptpb is a simple pastebin.

USE:

From the web: <a href="/f">Make a paste</a>

From the command line:
command | curl -F "c=<-" http://ptpb.pw

EXAMPLE:

cat /etc/resolv.conf | curl -F "c=<-" http://ptpb.pw
http://ptpb.pw/p/b55743ba

OTHER INFO:
Pastes will be kept as long as feasible, they may be deleted eventually though. Don't use ptpb for things you need to
keep around forever.

SSL coming soon.
